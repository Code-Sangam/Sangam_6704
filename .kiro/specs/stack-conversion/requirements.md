# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for converting the existing Sangam Alumni Network platform from its current Next.js/TypeScript/modern React stack to a more traditional web development stack using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, Express.js, and SQL database. The conversion should maintain all existing functionality while simplifying the technology stack and making it more accessible for traditional web development workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to convert the Next.js application to a traditional Express.js server-side application, so that I can use familiar backend patterns and have more control over server-side rendering and API endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is converted THEN the system SHALL use Express.js as the primary web server framework
2. WHEN serving pages THEN the system SHALL use server-side rendering with EJS or similar templating engine instead of Next.js App Router
3. WHEN handling API requests THEN the system SHALL use Express.js route handlers instead of Next.js API routes
4. WHEN serving static assets THEN the system SHALL use Express.js static middleware for CSS, JavaScript, and image files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace the complex TypeScript and modern React setup with vanilla JavaScript and traditional React patterns, so that the codebase is more accessible to developers familiar with standard web technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting components THEN the system SHALL use JavaScript instead of TypeScript
2. WHEN implementing React components THEN the system SHALL use traditional React patterns without Next.js specific features
3. WHEN bundling JavaScript THEN the system SHALL use Webpack or similar bundler instead of Next.js built-in bundling
4. WHEN writing code THEN the system SHALL avoid advanced TypeScript features and use standard JavaScript ES6+ syntax

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace the current database setup with a traditional SQL database and ORM, so that I can use familiar database patterns and SQL queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use a SQL database (PostgreSQL or MySQL) instead of LibSQL
2. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL use a traditional ORM like Sequelize or Knex.js instead of Drizzle ORM
3. WHEN defining schemas THEN the system SHALL use SQL DDL statements or ORM migrations
4. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL support both ORM methods and raw SQL queries

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to convert the Tailwind CSS and component library setup to traditional CSS and HTML, so that styling is more straightforward and customizable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL use traditional CSS files instead of Tailwind utility classes
2. WHEN creating UI components THEN the system SHALL use standard HTML elements and CSS instead of Radix UI components
3. WHEN organizing styles THEN the system SHALL use CSS modules or traditional CSS file structure
4. WHEN implementing responsive design THEN the system SHALL use CSS media queries instead of Tailwind responsive utilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain all existing functionality during the stack conversion, so that users experience no loss of features or capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting pages THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing routes and functionality
2. WHEN converting authentication THEN the system SHALL maintain login, registration, and session management
3. WHEN converting chat features THEN the system SHALL preserve real-time messaging capabilities
4. WHEN converting profiles THEN the system SHALL maintain user profile management and display
5. WHEN converting settings THEN the system SHALL preserve all user preference and account management features

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement traditional authentication and session management, so that I can use standard security practices without framework-specific authentication libraries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing authentication THEN the system SHALL use Express.js session middleware instead of better-auth
2. WHEN storing sessions THEN the system SHALL use traditional session stores (Redis or database-backed)
3. WHEN handling passwords THEN the system SHALL use bcrypt for hashing and validation
4. WHEN managing user sessions THEN the system SHALL implement standard session-based authentication patterns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement real-time features using traditional WebSocket libraries, so that chat functionality works with standard Node.js patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing real-time chat THEN the system SHALL use Socket.io or native WebSockets
2. WHEN handling real-time events THEN the system SHALL integrate WebSocket server with Express.js application
3. WHEN managing connections THEN the system SHALL handle user presence and connection state
4. WHEN broadcasting messages THEN the system SHALL support room-based messaging for different chat contexts

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to organize the project structure using traditional web application patterns, so that the codebase follows familiar conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL use traditional MVC or similar architectural pattern
2. WHEN structuring directories THEN the system SHALL separate routes, models, views, and controllers
3. WHEN managing configuration THEN the system SHALL use environment variables and configuration files
4. WHEN handling static assets THEN the system SHALL organize CSS, JavaScript, and images in public directories

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement proper error handling and logging, so that the application is maintainable and debuggable using standard Node.js practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL use Express.js error handling middleware
2. WHEN logging events THEN the system SHALL use traditional logging libraries like Winston or Morgan
3. WHEN handling validation THEN the system SHALL use server-side validation with libraries like Joi or express-validator
4. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and stack traces

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain responsive design and modern UI/UX, so that the converted application provides the same user experience as the original.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design using CSS media queries
2. WHEN rendering UI components THEN the system SHALL preserve the modern look and feel of the original design
3. WHEN implementing interactions THEN the system SHALL use vanilla JavaScript or jQuery for dynamic behavior
4. WHEN loading content THEN the system SHALL implement proper loading states and user feedback
