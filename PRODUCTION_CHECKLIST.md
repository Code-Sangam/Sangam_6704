## Emergency Procedures

### ðŸš¨ Application Down
1. Check PM2 status: `pm2 status`
2. Check application logs: `pm2 logs sangam-alumni-network`
3. Check system resources: `htop`, `df -h`
4. Restart application: `pm2 restart sangam-alumni-network`
5. If persistent, check database connectivity
6. Escalate to development team if needed

### ðŸš¨ Database Issues
1. Check PostgreSQL status: `sudo systemctl status postgresql`
2. Check database logs: `sudo tail -f /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-*.log`
3. Check disk space: `df -h`
4. Check database connections: `sudo -u postgres psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;"`
5. Restart PostgreSQL if needed: `sudo systemctl restart postgresql`
6. Restore from backup if corruption detected

### ðŸš¨ High Load/Performance Issues
1. Check system resources: `htop`, `iotop`
2. Check application performance: `pm2 monit`
3. Check database performance: Monitor slow queries
4. Scale horizontally if needed (add more PM2 instances)
5. Check for memory leaks in application
6. Optimize database queries if needed
